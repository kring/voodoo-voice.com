        <div class="heading">What is Voodoo Voice?</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        Voodoo Voice allows you to control <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a> using spoken voice commands.  Using
        your computer's microphone, you can give it commands such as "begin play",
        "next song", or "switch to &lt;name of song in play list&gt;".  It is very
        accurate and speaker independent.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        If you're considering putting a music-playing computer in your car, you need this!
        </div>
        <div class="heading">How well does this <i>really</i> work?</div>
        <div class="paragraph">  
        Even if you've been disappointed with speech recognition products in the past,
        you might be surprised by just how well Voodoo Voice works.  Most people that have
        used some kind of speech recognition program in the past have used a dictation program.
        Dictation programs promise to let you dictate text into your computer by reading it aloud.
        But dictation requires a lot of training (which means you spend entirely too much time
        reading outloud to your computer), and even then the results are disappointing.
        Voodoo Voice is different.  By responding to a much smaller vocabularly (but still
        including your entire playlist!), Voodoo Voice is able to achieve far better accuracy
        with much less training.

        <div class="paragraph">
        People around the world are using Voodoo Voice successfully, many in noisy environments like cars.

        <div class="heading">What are some of the features of Voodoo Voice?</div>
        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>
                Available voice commands:
                <ul>
                    <li>"begin play", "stop play"</li>
                    <li>
                        "next song", "previous song", "switch to &lt;name of song&gt;",
                        "play something by &lt;artist name&gt;"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "increase volume", "decrease volume", "set volume XX percent",
                        "enable/disable shuffle", "enable/disable repeat"
                    </li>
                    <li>"what is this?" - reads the name of the song aloud.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="Personalities.html">Voice Personalities</a> - Like voice skins, personalities make it more fun
                to interact with your computer.  A Voodoo Voice personality might make your computer sound like K.I.T.T. (the
                car from Knight Rider) or anything else you can imagine.  Personalities also provide valuable feedback when
                you can't look at the screen, such as in a car.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fully configurable - Voodoo Voice allows you to configure the spoken phrase that activates each command.
            </li>
